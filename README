Alert Sim is a simulator written in Clojure for the boardgame "The New Frontier",
an expansion pack for the game "Space Alert".
It's a fun programming exercise in Clojure to explore the complexities
of the rules, and see how well they can be implemented in multimethods.

If you are unfamiliar with Space Alert it's a great board game from
Czech Games, and I highly recommend it. Go buy it, it's that good.
