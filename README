Alert Sim is a simulator for the boardgame "Space Alert", written in Clojure.
It's a fun programming exercise in Clojure to see if I can get a computer
program to find some strategies and tactics for playing Space Alert.

If you are unfamiliar with Space Alert it's a great board game from
Czech Games, and I highly recommend it.
